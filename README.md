# ConsensysAcademy 2021 - Final Project


# Idea : 
User-friendly monthly dollar-cost averaging wallet + spending limit. Eventually to be deployed on an Eth L2 

# Workflow:
1. Users would set up initial wallet paramters and spending categories. E.g. users will select how much ETH, wBTC, and other tokens they would like to buy a month. Users can specify their minimum HODLing time-period for these investments.
2. Users can also set up monthly spending categories and limits.
3. Going forward, every month users would make a monthly deposits, and those funds will be invested/etc according to the user's initial instructions.


# Scope of project:
